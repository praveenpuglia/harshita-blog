I am not a sweet tooth baby but when it comes to mousse, I can't really resist.

The recipe for this, that I had learned in my class, is a plain coffee mousse with only a few ingredients. I wanted to add some delight to it. So! I have repurposed it by adding a few more ingredients which I think transforms a simple mousse to a delightful and exciting one. Let's dive in.

## Yield

5 to 6 Cups

## Prep Time

10 minutes

## Total Time

45 minutes

## Ingredients

### For the crust

Crushed 200 grams of Oreo cookies.

### For the Mousse

* ½ cup milk
* 100ml strawberry squash
* 100ml pineapple squash
* 1 tablespoon instant coffee powder
* 1½ cup whipped cream
* 2 tablespoons of powdered sugar
* ½ cup Pomegranate seeds

## Procedure

 1. In a bowl, mix the coffee powder with hot water. Mix the solution well and keep aside.
 2. In another bowl take the whipped cream and then add the coffee solution and the powdered sugar.
 3. Fold it gently until it becomes soft and smooth.
 4. Transfer the mixture into the freezer for 15 minutes and let it rest.
 5. Now divide the oreo cookies mixture equally in 6 mousse cups and level by pressing.
 6. Now pipe the mousse over the crust.
 7. Pipe the strawberry squash, pineapple squash and add pomegranate seeds.
 8. Now pipe the cream again to cover up.
 9. Garnish with the crushed cookies.
10. Set in refrigerator for 10 minutes.

\# Tips and Tricks

1\.Personalize your mousse by adding more fruits.  
2\.Don't over mix the cream or it will form grainy texture.  
3\.Using good quality of whipped cream can set out a good consistency.  
4\.You can top up this mousse with some vanilla flavored ice cream.  
Should be served chilled.
