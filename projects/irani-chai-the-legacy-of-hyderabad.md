No one wants to compromise with the taste of the tea. So today i giving out my own twist to Hyderabad's famous tea, the Irani Chai.

Irani Chai is an individual from the regular tea. It is prepared in in its own **Dum (steam)**. Its has its own flavour and taste. It is prepared with decoction and simmered in low flames.

So, let me tell you this was my first try of making Irani Chai. I love the way it turned out with the perfect taste and flavor.

So, let's begin...

## Yields

5 cups

## Prep Time

20 mins

## Cooking Time

50 mins (**yes, it requires a hell lot timeðŸ˜ª)**

## Ingredients

### For Tea Decoction

1 litre water

5 tbsp tea leaves

### For Milk

2 cups milk

5 tbsp sugar or jaggery (adjust)

3 - 4 pods green cardamom

Few strands saffron

30 grams khoya or dry milk

1 tbsp custard powder **(twist)**

# Procedure

* Place a pot in a medium flame, add water and tea leaves.
* Cover the pot with tight lid to prevent the steam to come out.
* Allow it to simmered at low flame for 30 mins for the proper Decoction.
* Meanwhile, take a saucepan add milk followed by the sugar or jaggery.
* Add the green cardamom, saffron, khoya or dry milk and custard powder.
* Stir well and cook the milk for 10 minutes over medium heat.
* Bring the milk to a boil. The consistency of milk should be creamy and thick.
* Remove from the flame and keep aside.
* Unlid the pot, be careful with the steam
* Strain the tea, pour the tea about 1/4th of the tea cup and add the milk to it.
* Serve the hot tea with some cookies, cakes and savoury.

## Points to remember

* You can use a mix of small and long tea leaves for a more fragrant and rich tea.
* You can use jaggery instead of sugar. Just adjust it as per taste.
* Use Full fat milk, for a thicker and creamier milk.
* You can use condensed milk or replace it with mava for much richer milk
