![](/uploads/IMG_20200413_163515.jpg)No one wants to compromise with the taste of the tea. So today i giving out my own twist to Hyderabad's famous tea, the Irani Chai.

Irani Chai is an individual from the regular tea. It is prepared in in its own **Dum (steam)**. Its has its own flavour and taste. It is prepared with decoction and simmered in low flames.

So, let me tell you this was my first try of making Irani Chai. I love the way it turned out with the perfect taste and flavor.

So, let's begin...

5 cups

50 mins (**yes, it requires a hell lot timeðŸ˜ª)**

## Points to remember

* You can use a mix of small and long tea leaves for a more fragrant and rich tea.
* You can use jaggery instead of sugar. Just adjust it as per taste.
* Use Full fat milk, for a thicker and creamier milk.
* You can use condensed milk or replace it with mava for much richer milk
